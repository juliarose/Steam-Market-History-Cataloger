# Steam Market History Cataloger

Steam Market History Cataloger is a Chrome extension used for loading and storing your listings from the [Steam Community Market](https://steamcommunity.com/market). Steam does not offer this data in a format that is easily consumible for those that need extensive information of their transactions. This tool aims to fulfill that role in a user-friendly way.

## Installation

To use this extension, please install it from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dhpcikljplaooekklhbjohojbjbinega).

## Features

-   Loads transactions from the [Steam Community Market](https://steamcommunity.com/market) in any language or currency. Listings are stored to a local database in your browser for use at any time.
-   Allows viewing and filtering of all data loaded in a neat and responsive format within the extension.
-   Transaction data can be exported to JSON and CSV. Data models for JSON can be found [below](#models).
-   Loads purchase history from your [Steam account history](https://store.steampowered.com/account/history). However, this data is not persisted to the extension.
-   Allows background loading. Not enabled by default. Enable this option from the preferences page. Loads are polled at an interval of 1 hour.
-   History pages at <https://steamcommunity.com/market> are displayed 100 results per page. More options are provided which allow you to move around your history easier.

## Known Issues

-   Since history results do not usually include the year of the date, the extension must make a best guess for the year. If you have gaps larger than a year in your history results you may experience issues. This issue may or may not be resolved in the future.
-   Any refunded transactions will persist if they were not refunded at the time of loading. There is no way to remove them from your results at this point unless you clear your entire listing data.
